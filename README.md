# STM32_HC05
This is a PCB board designed in KiCAD which implements a STM32F746VGT6 microcontroller exposing the following pins and internal connections. All of the GPIO pins support timer peripheral output, for a more detailed view of the potential PIN function, check the STM32F7 datasheet using name as a reference. Please read [STM32F7 Reference page](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f7-series.html) and [Getting Started Guide](https://www.st.com/resource/en/user_manual/dm00180213-getting-started-with-stm32cubef7-mcu-package-for-stm32f7-series-stmicroelectronics.pdf).
